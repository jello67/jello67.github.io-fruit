My project teaches about fruits! I made it to educate about fruits and their various properties and benefits. There are many types of fruits, trivia and more! I made my project using HTML and CSS incorporating buttons and various other elements. I struggled with understanding and keeping up with the complexities of the code and got stuck on bugs for a long time. I learned about how to incorporate buttons and style my page better using CSS.
